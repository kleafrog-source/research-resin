GLOSSARY_TERMS = {
    "Adsorption": "The adhesion of atoms, ions, or molecules from a gas, liquid, or dissolved solid to a surface. This process creates a film of the adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent.",
    "Anion Exchange": "A type of ion exchange where negatively charged ions (anions) are exchanged between a solution and a solid resin. Anion exchange resins are used to remove contaminants like nitrates, sulfates, and organic acids.",
    "Anion Exchange Capacity (AEC)": "The total number of exchangeable anions that a resin can hold per unit volume or weight. It is a measure of the resin's operational capacity.",
    "Cation Exchange": "A type of ion exchange where positively charged ions (cations) are exchanged. Cation exchange resins are commonly used for water softening (removing Ca²+ and Mg²⁺) and demineralization.",
    "Cross-linking": "The process of chemically joining polymer chains together. In ion exchange resins, this is typically done using divinylbenzene (DVB). The degree of cross-linking affects the resin's stability, swelling behavior, and porosity.",
    "Fouling": "The irreversible contamination of an ion exchange resin by substances that are not removed during regeneration. Common foulants include iron, manganese, oils, and certain organic molecules.",
    "Fulvic Acid": "A type of natural organic matter (NOM) that is a component of humus. It is a complex organic acid that can be removed from water by certain ion exchange resins.",
    "Functional Group": "The active chemical group on the resin polymer that is responsible for the ion exchange process. Examples include sulfonic acid (-SO₃H) for strong acid cation resins and quaternary ammonium groups for strong base anion resins.",
    "Gel Resin": "A type of ion exchange resin with a dense, microporous internal structure. Gel resins have no discrete pores and swell in water to allow ions to pass through the gel matrix.",
    "Humic Acid": "A principal component of humus, a type of natural organic matter (NOM). It is a high molecular weight organic acid that can cause yellow or brown color in water and can be a precursor to disinfection byproducts.",
    "Ion Exchange Resin": "An insoluble, porous, polymer-based material that can exchange its mobile ions for ions of similar charge from a surrounding solution.",
    "Macroporous Resin": "A type of ion exchange resin with a multichannelled structure and discrete, large pores. This structure provides high accessibility for ions and is often used for removing large organic molecules.",
    "Particle Size": "The diameter of the resin beads. Particle size affects the kinetics of the ion exchange process and the pressure drop across a resin bed.",
    "PFAS (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances)": "A large group of synthetic chemicals used in various industrial and consumer products. They are persistent environmental pollutants that can be removed from water using specialized ion exchange resins.",
    "Porosity": "A measure of the void spaces in a material. In ion exchange resins, porosity affects the diffusion of ions to the exchange sites and is a key difference between gel and macroporous types.",
    "Regeneration": "The process of restoring a 'spent' or exhausted ion exchange resin to its original ionic form. This is typically done by washing the resin with a concentrated solution of the desired ion (e.g., sodium chloride for water softeners).",
    "Selectivity": "The preference of an ion exchange resin for one type of ion over another. Selectivity is determined by factors like ionic charge, size, and the chemical structure of the resin.",
    "Sorption": "A physical and chemical process by which one substance becomes attached to another. It is a broader term that includes both adsorption and absorption.",
    "Swelling": "The change in volume of an ion exchange resin when it is immersed in a solvent. The degree of swelling is an important physical characteristic that depends on the resin's cross-linking and ionic form.",
    "Tannins": "A class of natural organic compounds that are often found in surface water supplies. They can cause a yellow or brown color and can be removed by specialized 'organic scavenger' anion resins.",
    "Thermal Stability": "The ability of a resin to withstand high temperatures without significant degradation of its polymer structure or functional groups.",
    "Total Organic Carbon (TOC)": "A measure of the total amount of carbon in organic compounds in a water sample. It is a general indicator of water quality, and high TOC can be a precursor to disinfection byproducts."
